first download the repository

to convert a video:
1. place your video in the folder
2. run "videoExtract.py" wait for it to finish
(Note: if an FFMPEG error shows, ignore it. This is planned to be part of the audio.)
3. Run either "toASCII.py" or "toColourASCII" and wait for it to finish
4. open a terminal and navigate to the folder with the python scripts
5. run "play.py"
